Hi there, I'm Ben-hur Arteaga Vasconcelos! 👋
I'm an Android development enthusiast, exploring the world of mobile development within the Dev Space community. Here's a bit about me:

🔭 Currently, I'm focused on Android development, honing my skills in Kotlin and actively contributing to projects on the platform.



📚 I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Development at BYU - Idaho, where I'm diving deeper into Python and JavaScript, thereby expanding my skillset.



💼 Besides my software development journey, I bring solid experience in customer service, sales, and B2B business. My ability to listen and understand customer needs, combined with my sales experience, has propelled my growth in these areas.



👨‍💻 I'm involved in hands-on Android development projects, actively contributing to feature improvements and expansion. I'm gaining proficiency in technologies like Kotlin, XML, and Git, while continuing to explore new opportunities in the Android universe.



🚀 I'm excited to collaborate on challenging projects and continue my learning journey in software development. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/benvasconcelos) profile!
